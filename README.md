# Introduction
Primerose was my second project during Ironhack bootcamp in Paris.

I collaborated with another student to create this MVP in 4 days. Primerose is actually a marketplace where amateur fashion designers can sell their products.
Clients can create an account and buy clothes that are available on the plateform.
If you want to sell your own products, you can create your shop directly from your client profile.

We used the following technologies: Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDB, Handlebars.

You can access it here: https://primrose-marketplace.herokuapp.com/
